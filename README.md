Project Description:

This web project presents an interactive interface showcasing the planets of our solar system. Developed using HTML and CSS, it features a visually appealing design that enhances user engagement through dynamic interactions.

Key Features:

Interactive Planet List: A clean, user-friendly list of planets allows for easy navigation. Each planet is represented as a link that fades upon hover, creating an engaging experience.

Dynamic Visual Effects: The project utilizes scaling and color transitions for each link on hover, while the name of the planet gracefully appears below, reinforcing the interactive nature of the design.

Aesthetic Design: The layout incorporates a dark theme with a gradient background and a starry image, complemented by vibrant accent colors. This approach not only ensures readability but also aligns with the cosmic theme of the project.
