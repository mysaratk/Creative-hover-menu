Project Description
This web project features a visually engaging interface that highlights the planets of our solar system. Built using HTML and CSS, the design employs a stunning gradient background and a starry image to evoke a celestial atmosphere.

Key Features:

Interactive List: The project showcases a list of planets, each represented by a stylized link. When users hover over the links, the text becomes transparent, revealing an underlying animation.
Dynamic Effects: Each planet link scales up and changes color on hover, enhancing user engagement. Below each link, the name of the planet is displayed in bold, large text, fading in with a smooth transition as users interact with the list.
Visual Style: The use of a dark theme complemented by bright accent colors (dark blue, dark magenta, and orangered) creates a striking contrast, making the text easily readable while contributing to the overall cosmic aesthetic.
